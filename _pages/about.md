I recently graduated from Ironhack's Data Analytics Bootcamp, and before that I used to be a physics student. I would like to pair my programming and mathematical skills to join the world of Data Analysis. I continue to stay up to date by teaching myself new technologies and best practices by using both online resources including Coursera, Kaggle and Youtube, as well as academic books to improve my background on certain areas such as Statistical Inference.

I met the world of data for the first time in my summer internship at Oxford's University, where I studied the population distribution of RR Lyrae stars. I enjoyed every aspect of the statistical analysis as well as the programming behind it. In Ironhack's Bootcamp I learned both how to use and understand a large set of modern technologies to analyze data in many different situations. 
You can have a look at my projects <a href='/al-folio/projects/'>here</a>.

Main technologies: Python, Machine Learning, Web Scraping, SQL, Tableau, Excel, Matlab

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. --->
