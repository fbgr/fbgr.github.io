As a recent graduate of Ironhack's Data Analytics Bootcamp, I am eager to put my unique skillset to work in the field of Data Analysis. My background in physics gives me a strong foundation in quantitative reasoning, and my experience in coding allows me to tackle data challenges with both precision and creativity. I am always striving to stay current in the field, and continuously educate myself through online resources as well as academic literature to learn more about technical areas such as Statistical Inference.

My journey into the world of data began with a summer internship at Oxford University, where I had the opportunity to study the population distribution of RR Lyrae stars. Later at the bootcamp, I gained a thorough understanding of a wide range of modern technologies and learned how to effectively apply them in various analysis scenarios. If you are interested in viewing any of my projects, you can take a look at all of them in this <a href='/projects/'>section</a>.

**Main technologies**: Python, SQL, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Web Scraping, Tableau, Excel, Matlab.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
