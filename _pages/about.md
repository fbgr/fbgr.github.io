As a Data Scientist Trainee, I am excited to further develop my skill set and contribute to the ever-evolving field of data science. Building on my foundations in physics and quantitative reasoning, I now apply rigorous data analysis techniques to tackle business challenges. My coding experience equips me to handle diverse datasets with precision, while my creative problem-solving skills enable me to deliver actionable insights.

My journey into the realm of data began with a summer internship at Oxford University, where I had the chance to study the population distribution of RR Lyrae stars. This experience was enriched by my time at Ironhackâ€™s Data Analytics Bootcamp, where I gained comprehensive knowledge in modern technologies and their practical application across various analytical frameworks. Committed to lifelong learning, I continuously update my expertise through online resources and academic literature, focusing on technical areas such as Statistical Inference, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. If you are interested in viewing any of my projects, you can check them <a href='/projects/'>here</a>.

**Main technologies**: Python, SQL, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Web Scraping, Tableau, Excel, Matlab.
